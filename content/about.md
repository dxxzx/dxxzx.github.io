Hi All,
This is Dylan Deng, Dylan for short.

I'm a software developer, I am originlly a Android App developer. Then I started using python to develop automatic test suite. But I am a Android System developer now.

June 2015, I graduated from university. I didn't choose to work, I chose to be trained as a Android App developer. Dec. 2015, I became a Android App developer.
March 2016, I resigned from my company. Then, I start to find another job. This time, I want a job which research Android System. Then, I got a opportunity to work in Sony as a outsource engineer. At the end of March, I join Sony as a outsource engineer. But dramatically, I didn't became a Android System developer, but became a automatic test suite developer.
March 2017, I'm tired of being a test suite developer. So, I resigned my job again. At this time, artificial intelligence was very hot. I want to study this technology. But I fail again. This time, I became a Android System Developer, I achieve my dream I ever have.
